I have created an online shopping page using HTML and CSS, and there is still more work to be done.

As a Junior Front-End Developer with foundational skills in HTML and CSS, I am passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly web pages. My goal is to leverage my basic knowledge to contribute effectively to web development projects.
